# Liri-Bot
HW 10: Node JSLIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Demos 
Using the following command line inputs, data is written to terminal & saved to log.txt
`node liri.js concert-this`
